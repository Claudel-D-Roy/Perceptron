# Perceptron

Project carried out during the fourth session of my software development program.

## Project Specification

The project involved the first use of the perceptron with the structure of design patterns. It was a team project.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to create a program that recognizes handwritten characters using the perceptron algorithm. You are not allowed to use existing libraries. The user should be able to draw characters and specify which character it is. Then, the perceptron will learn and be able to identify the drawn character.

### 3-Tier Model

During the implementation of your application, you must always keep in mind the use of the 3-tier model. You need to structure your application and modeling into three layers. It is imperative to place each class in the correct directories that you will create.

### Features to Implement

Here are the features you need to implement:

- Train a perceptron for each character (response).
- Test each perceptron for a drawing passed as a parameter.
- Save and load training samples.
- Display learning statistics in the console.
- Display possible responses to a character in the appropriate Textbox.
